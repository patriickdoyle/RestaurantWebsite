            <!-- web dev experience -->
            <p>
                I have absolutely no experience in web development or design. However, I have created several applications
                for Android devices, and I assumed this class would be similar (it is.) I am hoping to develop my web application
                skills throughout this semester and obtain the elusive title of a Full Stack Developer.
            </p>

            <!-- database details -->
            <p>
                For this project, I plan on using a database implementation where users are customers and the other table is the menu.
                Here are some of the fields I plan on using in this other table:
            </p>

            <!-- UL of database fields -->
            <ul>
                <li>URL pointing to an image of the food </li>
                <li>Price of food</li>
                <li>Date ordered</li>
                <li>Description of food experience</li>
                <li>1-5 star review</li>

            </ul>

            <!-- what did I find hard about this homework -->
            <p>
                This homework has really not been too difficult for me thankfully. Having experience with Android development has made
                this transition relatively smooth. At first, I was a little intimidated because there were just a lot of concepts thrown
                at us from CSS, but as soon as I put my head down and started focusing on learning it, it was easy.
